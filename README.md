## Description

[Click here for link to deployed app on Heroku](https://du-event-listeners.herokuapp.com/)

-As our coding bootcamp came to a close, we wanted to create a way for all the students to keep in touch and continue to collaborate and share ideas in an easy, organized, and effecient way. We did this through a resources, forum, and events page. On these pages users are able to add links to helpful resources, ask for help in the forum, or add an event and see all events available on our events page. We also created a live chat feature within our application to speak with other users who are online at the same time. This will help all of us continue to develop as professional coders, pursue employement oppurtunities, and further our knowledge as a collective!

-We built this application using a MERN stack. We utilized React as our front end, we created our own API and used GraphQL to fetch the data without over fetching. This app is utilizing MongoDB back end along with Express using an Apollo Server.
